This model is used to explore  transition pathways to a net-zero electricity system. As with all energy system  models, the inputs include a range of datasets and assumptions (e.g. technology  cost projections, discount rates). All of these inputs are described here in  order to allow for the model to be reviewed, re-run, and re-purposed.</p>"},{"location":"1_indonesia/#model-scope","title":"Model scope","text":"<p>The model aims to represent the electricity system of Indonesia as accurately as possible, subject to constraints on data and computation time.
